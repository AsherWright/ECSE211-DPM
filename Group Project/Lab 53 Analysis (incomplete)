I have not got around to do this yet...

1: Wall follower - our P-controller was beautiful. 
2: Odometery - terrible, we used the TA's code (given) in the end
3: Object avoidance - terrible, ""
4: Localization: Alright...
5: Finding objects: not the best. Simple algorithm that rarely works. Block detection was OK.
